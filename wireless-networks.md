# Wireless networks

So you now need to create the wireless networks that the devices will connect to. I tend to have two (plus a guest network). Given that there seems to be much `magic` associated with these settings on the forum, these may not be the most optimal settings but for me, in my location with a mix of 2.4g, 5g, Wifi5 and Wifi6 clients they seem to work. Always welcome to other views that can increase throughput...
