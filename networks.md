# Networks Setup

## HOME LAN

Out of the box there should be a network called LAN already created. You can check this by going to [https://192.168.1.1/network/default/settings/networks](https://192.168.1.1/network/default/settings/networks) assuming that you have the default ip range running. 

I double-check that `Content Filtering` is set to `NONE` as if I want content filtering it will be via the Pi-Hole rather than some random set of urls applied.
                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
## IoT LAN

So this is the LAN that will be used by all of our IoT devices. Its going to pretty much mimic the same setup as above but with a couple of changes. 

To create a new LAN just click the `create` button on the top-right hand side of the new Unifi UI interface. 

The key consideration is the number you assign to the VLAN ID. Leave it blank and it will just merge with the LAN you created earlier. We need to set it to a value and I use `107` as it looks a bit like `IoT`so it works as a nice and simple aide-memoir.

Great for a guest network, less good for your home LAN..                                                            |

If you don't have one then I'd recommend NextDNS or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). You can always set it to AUTO and it will just pickup whatever DNS server your ISP provides. |
